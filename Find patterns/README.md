Given two strings S and W. Find the number of times W appears as a subsequence of string S where every character of string S can be included in forming at most one subsequence.

# Example 
Input: <br>
 S = "abcdrtbwerrcokokokd" <br>
 W = "bcd" <br>
Output: <br>
 2
Explanation: <br>
The two subsequences of string W are<br>
{ S1 , S2 , S3 } and { S6 , S11 , S18 }<br>
(Assuming 0- based indexing).
