Given two strings S and W. Find the number of times W appears as a subsequence of string S where every character of string S can be included in forming at most one subsequence.

# Example 
Input: 
 S = "abcdrtbwerrcokokokd" 
 W = "bcd" 
Output: 
 2
Explanation: 
The two subsequences of string W are
{ S1 , S2 , S3 } and { S6 , S11 , S18 }
(Assuming 0- based indexing).
